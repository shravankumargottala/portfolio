	<h3><u>Project Description:</u></h3><br>
      <div class="project-container_1 project-card">
          <p>
            Code Assessment Tool is designed to help the developer/reviewer to check if the standard coding formats are being followed in Informatica, UNIX and Teradata (BTEQ) scripts, It points out the exact line of code at which the violation is identified and defines whether the identified issue is an error or a warning and states the coding standard that has been violated. It enables developer to have a quick reference at the code and make necessary changes so as to promote the code to next higher environment (SIT, UAT, IR, PROD).
			Automated project reduce the possibility of errors by the Application Development teams in the Source Codes and also minimize the efforts of the Code Reviewers, by sending the consolidated report to the developer and/or reviewer.
